# LogData

logdata.py .log files generated by Gaussian. It extracts the interesting values and build a dataframe by merging  data from the hdf files (generated by geomdata) and data extracted from .log file. 
All helpers for extracting values such as energy, forces, dipole... are stored inside Utils/gaussian.py. 

# Args
## inputs
1. --logdir : parent directory containing all .log files (note that there is one log file for each molecule)
2. --infile : hdf file used to generate these log files. This file is needed if you want the script to automatically merge the data.
3. --outfile : hdf output file containing all the data

## outputs
A hdf file containing data from the infile and extracted data from the .log files.

# Example
	python logdata.py --logdir logDirectoryMol1 --infile Mol1.h5 --outfile Mol1_all.h5
