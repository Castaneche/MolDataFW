# Clustering

Reduce the database to a specific percentage using clustering method. This folder contains two files : a python script and a notebook. The notebook is for testing purposes of the KMeans algorithm and to display interesting graphs such as inertia or centroids. clustering.py perform KMeans algorithm on data preprocessed with ../wACSF/Gcalc.py script.

You might want to tweak some parameters inside the clustering.py file such as number of clusters (k) or percentage of each cluster to select (percentage)

# Args
## inputs
1. --infile : the original database file (.h5) to retrieve selected molecule from.
2. --infileG : .h5 file obtained when running ../wACSF/Gcalc.py script on the infile.
3. --outfile : reduced database (.h5)

## outputs
A hdf file containing fewer molecules than the original database.

# Example
	python clustering.py --infile original.h5 --infileG original_G.h5 --outfile reduced.h5
