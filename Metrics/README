# Metrics

This folder provides python scripts to display histograms of energy, forces, dipole of the .h5 database. 
extract_data.py provide a way to extract and convert energy, forces and dipole from hdf file to csv file. This way it is easier to retrieve the data and plot histograms. Usage:

	python --indir dirContaininghdfFiles --outfile outfilenameWithoutExtension --energy --dipole --force
If you don't want to plot dipole or forces or energy, just remove the parameter from the command.	

Analysis.ipynb is a notebook outputting all sort of histograms.
