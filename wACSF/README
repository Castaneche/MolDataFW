Compute G functions (see article at https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019667) for each atom of the database. Needed data are first packed to a single data array to compute the G functions in a single call (faster). This script is supposed to work with clustering.py inside the ../Clustering folder.

# Args
## inputs
1. --infile : the input .h5 file containing molecule data
2. --outfileG : .h5 file containing G functions for each atom

## outputs
A hdf file containing G functions for each atom.
